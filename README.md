Welcome to the backend for the Full Stack Deployment example!

This code was left in a state that assumes you were just wrapping it up and preparing it for deployment.

To start off in your local environment and test, you need to create a venv and install:
flask
flask-cors
mariadb
autopep8

Normally I would supply you with a requirements.txt, but I'm going to make you do this part yourself!
